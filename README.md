This project is a dungeon crawler game where the player is placed into a randomly generated dungeon and fights animated skeletons, trying not to let their health bar go to zero.
The player gets 5 points of score for each skeleton they kill. The player can also enter a trap door to go to a new randomly generated dungeon. Each time the player enters a new
dungeon, they will earn 20 points of score and there will be 1 more skeleton to fight than in the previous dungeon. The player can see their health bar and score at the top
left. They can also see their score again when they die, and the highest score they achieved will be shown on the title screen.

To rotate, the player can press the left and right arrow keys. To move forward or backward, the player can press the up or down arrow keys respectively. The player can fire an
arrow at the skeleton by pressing spacebar. Each skeleton will die upon being hit by an arrow. The player can enter the trapdoor to the next level simply by walking over it.

This game includes sound for arrows being shot and hitting skeletons, as well as homemade background music.
